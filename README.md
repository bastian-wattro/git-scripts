# Setup

(feel free to replace ~/.local/bin with some other folder)
```
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cd $!
git clone git@github.com:bastian-wattro/git-scripts.git
```

Make sure this is in your path (maybe add this to your .bashrc)
`export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

now in some repo, run `git status-branch`
